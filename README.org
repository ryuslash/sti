~sti~ is a simplistic tool installer written in Bash. It offers simple
commands to help installing little tools you or others have written.
This document will try to explain to you how to use it.

Bug reports, feature requests, asking for help, and such things can be
sent to [[mailto:tom@ryuslash.org][tom@ryuslash.org]].

* Installation

  The =sti= source is stored in a git repository. It can be cloned from
  the URL ~git://ryuslash.org/sti.git~.

  Installing =sti= is simple. Just put the =sti= executable file somewhere
  in your =$PATH= and you can start using it. You can also download the
  executable anywhere and use it from there.

  Another option is to use =sti= to install itself. That way it should
  be easier to keep it updated as well. To do this, download sti from,
  for example, the git repository, and run it with the sti git
  repository url. For example:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ curl http://code.ryuslash.org/sti/plain/sti
    $ ./sti install git://ryuslash.org/sti.git
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Since =sti= installs all executables in =~/usr/bin= you should make sure
  that this directory is included in =$PATH=.
